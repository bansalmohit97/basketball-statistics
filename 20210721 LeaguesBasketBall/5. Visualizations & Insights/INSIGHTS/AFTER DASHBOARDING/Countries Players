This worsheet denotes the number of athletes coming from different countries.

The maximum contribution made by the country towards the game is the United States with a total number of 4761 different players, followed by Argentina with a much lesser number of 260. There are many such countries which have no such contributions to the game. 

A deeper thought must be given to those nations whose contribution of players towards the game is incompetent and even nothing, for that matter.

It is not even the case that the more the number from US, lessr will be their PER. Infact, it's the other way round, the PER and 3 point accuracy is above average for all the age groups denoting how fit the players are and how it directly impacts their efficiency and effectiveness.
